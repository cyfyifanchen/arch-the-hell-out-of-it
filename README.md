Here is what I wanna say from the very beginning, and I intend to hold onto this belief for the rest of my cat's life. :alien:

> Architecting a large-scale web app may not be as daunting as it seems; much of the uncertainty hinges on the availability of resources and timing. The key takeaway is that there's no one-size-fits-all solution. It's a complex landscape of trade-offs, where decisions must be made carefully to strike the right balance.


When embarking on the architectural journey of a new web application, one of the foundational decisions that demands careful consideration is the approach to content rendering. This decision hinges on where and how you want content to be displayed â€“ whether it should materialize on the web server, build server, at the Edge, or directly on the client. Moreover, you must ponder whether content should be rendered in its entirety, in part, or progressively.

These pivotal choices are intrinsically tied to the specific use case of your application. The selection of the most fitting rendering pattern can wield a profound impact on both the Developer Experience (DX) for your engineering team and the User Experience (UX) you craft for your end users.

Opting for the correct rendering pattern has the potential to yield expedited build times, exceptional loading performance, and cost-effective processing. Conversely, a misguided choice can spell doom for an application that could have otherwise breathed life into a promising business idea. Thus, it becomes imperative to ensure that every groundbreaking concept you envision is developed with the most appropriate rendering pattern in mind.
